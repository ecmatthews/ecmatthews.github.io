I'm passionate about science communication, and have delivered several talks, events, and outreach stalls at science festivals. In recent years I delivered telescope tours at the MPIA open house (Tag der Offenen TÃ¼r), and delivered planetarium shows at the Geneva Observatory 250th anniversary celebration. Previously, I led the [Astronomy on Tap Boston](https://www.facebook.com/aotboston/) team while in MIT, and the [Pint of Science Exeter](https://pintofscience.co.uk/events/exeter) team while in Exeter. I was selected as the lecturer for the 2017 Institute of Physics School's Tour, where I gave 14 talks at schools in Devon and Cornwall, and as a PhD student I wrote several articles for [astrobites.org](https://astrobites.org). See my astrobites articles [here](https://astrobites.org/author/ematthews/).

Watch me present my thesis work in the national final of the [IOP 3 Minute Wonder](https://www.iop.org/3mw) competition below:
