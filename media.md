Here are some links to selected media coverage of my results, and press appearances, videos and articles that I've written.

I'm always happy to speak to journalists about my science, and about exoplanets and astrophysics more broadly, and I can take media requests in both English and German. Get in touch at [matthews@mpia.de](mailto:matthews@mpia.de).
