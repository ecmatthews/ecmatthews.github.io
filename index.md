# Hi!

Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy](https://www.mpia.de/en) in Heidelberg, where I'm pursuing independent research to discover and characterize the planetary systems of nearby stars.

My main research focus is combining direct and indirect measurements of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Radial velocity and astrometric accelerations of nearby stars can hint towards the presence of unseen substellar companions, which might be directly detectable with high-contrast imaging observations. Systems where direct and indirect and indirect observations can be combined are particularly valuable, since they allow for precise mass and luminosity measurements that can be used to calibrate theoretical models of exoplanet thermal evolution. RV and astrometric data can also point the way towards key systems of interest, helping to optimally make use of precious telescope resources and discover prime targets for atmospheric characterization.

Aside from this, I've used my high-resolution imaging skills to contribute to the confirmation of several close-in planets, as part of the [TESS](https://tess.mit.edu/\
) follow-up program. TESS finds transiting planets, and by searching for faint companions to the planet host I ensure that planet radii are measured correctly and check that the signal really is originating from the star we think. I also work on understanding debris disks -- belts of planetesimals and dust analogous to the asteroid and kuiper belts in our solar system -- and how they interact with giant exoplanets in the outer reaches of nearby stellar systems.
