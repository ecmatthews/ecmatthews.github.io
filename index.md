# Hi!

Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher at the MPIA in Heidelberg, where I use observations with world class telescopes to study the planetary systems of nearby stars.

Most of my research uses high resolution and high contrast adaptive optics imaging. I'm interested in understanding the frequency and properties of exoplanet systems, and in particular the architectures of exoplanet systems, and the interactions of exoplanets with debris disks and companion stars. I've been leading programs to search for long-period exoplanets and brown dwarfs with the [SPHERE](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/sphere.html) instrument at the [Very Large Telescopes](https://www.eso.org/public/usa/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/), and I contributed to a large program searching for planets with the [NIRC2](https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/nirc2/) instrument at the [Keck Observatory](http://www.keckobservatory.org/). More recently, I've been thinking about how we can use hints from radial velocity and astrometry to design highly targeted direct imaging campaigns. I've also contributed to the [TESS](https://tess.mit.edu/) follow-up program. TESS finds transiting planets, and by searching for faint companions to the planet host I ensure that planet radii are measured correctly and check that the signal really is originating from the star we think.

I completed my PhD in 2018 at the University of Exeter, where I worked with Prof Sasha Hinkley. Since then I've spent time working as a postdoc at MIT, at the University of Geneva (as part of the [PlanetS](http://nccr-planets.ch/) collaboration), and most recently at the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy](https://www.mpia.de/en) in Heidelberg.

I'm passionate about science communication, with my most recent scicomm adventure being leading the [Astronomy on Tap Boston](https://www.facebook.com/aotboston/) team. I've also mentored high school and undergraduate students through the [JuRA @ MIT](https://clarasousasilva.com/jura) program. Previously, I was the lecturer for the Institute of Physics School's Tour, where I gave 14 talks at schools in Devon and Cornwall, and as a PhD student I wrote several articles for [astrobites.org](https://astrobites.org). See my astrobites articles [here](https://astrobites.org/author/ematthews/).

Watch me present my thesis work in the national final of the [IOP 3 Minute Wonder](https://www.iop.org/activity/3-minute-wonder/page_60438.html#gref) competition below:
