            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>We imaged 20 stars hosting dusty debris disks with VLT/SPHERE. Giant, wide separation planets are believed to be associated with debris disks, and stars with debris disks are typically young. These are therefore excellent locations to search for new planets in thermal emission, and for the disks themselves in scattered light. We reached a median sensitivity of 2.1M<sub>J</sub> at 100AU, but did not detect planets in this survey. We detected three stellar companions, two of which are ~M4 stars, and the third is late-K or early-M. All of these stellar companions accompany old stars, with two of the host stars having recently left the main sequence, and the third being more evolved. This is a surprising result, and we suggest that these debris disks are transient and were formed in recent, massive collisions within the planetary systems. </p>

            <p> I'm a postdoc, currently based at MIT and soon moving to the University of Geneva. I primarily work on direct imaging observations, where I'm particularly interested in the connection between planets and debris disks, and also on the validation of TESS planet candidates.

            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p> Debris disks are believed to be associated with giant planets on long orbits. This has been thoerized (e.g. <a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.399.1403M/abstract'>Mustill & Wyatt 2009</a>) and tentatively observationally confirmed (<a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....154..245M/abstract'>Meshkat et al. 2017</a>). Debris disks are also typically young (e.g. <a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...620.1010R/abstract'>Rieke et al. 2005</a>, <a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...663..365W/abstract'>Wyatt et al. 2007</a>, <a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...663..365W/abstract'>Su et al. 2006</a>, <a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJS..181..197C/abstract'>Carpenter et al. 2009</a>). As such, <b>giant planets should be easier to image in debris disk systems</b>: the planets are likely more prevalent, and they are brighter, since they are still re-radiating their formation energy.</p>

            <p> We therefore carried out a direct imaging survey of 20 highly dusty systems, using the state-of-the-art SPHERE high-contrast imager at the VLT (<a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJS..181..197C/abstract'>Beuzit et al. 2019</a>). <b>We selected targets from the all-sky WISE Catalog</b> (<a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012yCat.2311....0C/abstract'>Cutri et al. 2012</a>), identified as debris disk stars by <a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AAS...21733305P/abstract'>Padgett et al. 2011</a>. The targets all have a large [W1]-[W4] excess, indicating significant mid-infrared emission, a high quality cross-match between the <i>Hipparcos</i> and WISE source positions, and either a <i>Hipparcos</i> measured distance within 120pc, or a proper motion >30mas/yr as a proxy for proximity. Observations and data reduction followed the procedure described in <a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.480.2757M/abstract'>Matthews et al. (2018)</a>. Each target was observed for ~2200s, using the SPHERE-IRDIFS configuration, where we <b>simultaneously collect narrow-band images in the H filter (~1.6&micro;m), and low-resolution spectroscopy in the YJ bands (0.95-1.3&micro;m)</b>. </p>

            <h3>Detections</h3>
            <p>We detected <b>three stellar companions.</b>. Thumbnail images of these stellar companions are shown below. Two of these are coronagraphic images; in the third the host star is unocculted.</p>

            <p>Two of these three companions (the left and center thumbnail) were inside the field of view of the SPHERE-IFS instrument, meaning that we could extract spectra between 0.95-1.3&micro;m. The left hand spectrum is noisy, but taking the absolute magnitude into account we classify the star as M4&plusmn;2. The right hand spectrum is classified as M4&plusmn;1.</p>

            <h3>Survey Sensitivity</h3>
            <p> In this plot we show the sensitivity of the survey, both in instrumental and physical units. Sensitivity limits are calculated in the H2 filter (1.593&micro;m) and converted to planet mass using the DUSTY and COND models (<a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...542..464C/abstract'>Chabrier et al. 2000</a>, <a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003A%26A...402..701B/abstract'>Baraffe et al. 2003</a>).</p>
            <img src='https://ecmatthews.github.io/exo3poster/dotd_surveysensitivity.png' width='100%' height='auto'>
            <p> Note that one target was found to have a bright companion, which significantly reduces our sensitivity at small separations. Two targets in the survey are older, and in these cases our mass sensitivity is significantly reduced relative to the typical survey performance. </p>
            <p> <b> The median sensitivity of the survey is 7.8M<sub>J</sub> at 20AU and 2.1M<sub>J</sub> at 100AU. </b></p>

        </div>

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <p>We carried out a careful <b>age determination</b> for our targets. We searched for moving group memberships, referred to literature where available, and performed isochrone fitting otherwise. For one target, we were unable to determine an age, but the star is a giant.</p>
            <img src='https://ecmatthews.github.io/exo3poster/dotd_agehist.png' width='100%' height='auto'>

            <p>The histogram shows the distribution of ages in our survey, with stars with companions highlighted.  Several of targets in the survey are young, but <b>a number of older objects were also observed.</b> In particular, two of the stars with companions have recently left the main sequence, and the evolved star also hosts a companion (not shown in the histogram).</p>

            This is surprising, since debris disks are far more common around young stars. It is also striking that several of the older stars in the survey have stellar companions. A few older debris disks are known, such as kappa CrB (<a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.431.3025B/abstract'>Bonsor et al. 2013</a>), and BD+20 307 (<a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...726...72W/abstract'>Weinberger et al. 2011</a>). For BD+20 307, Weinberger et al. determined that <b>the large volumes of dust had recently been produced in a cataclysmic collision within the system</b>. Theory suggests that stellar evolution in a binary system can cause complex dynamical evolution of planetary systems (<a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...753...91K/abstract'>Kratter & Perets 2012</a>): perhaps this dynamical evolution caused cataclysmic collisions, and has temporarily elevated the level of dust in the systems we observed for a short time. We suggest that this is the case for the old stars in our survey: the binary configuration has caused the planet orbits to evolve, prompting a massive collision, perhaps between a planet and a planetesimal belt, which generated high volumes of transient dust. </p>
